# Ransomware-Attack
  My project is about spreading ransomware named "Psycho" using a Trojan technique, where a fake game webpage tricks victims into downloading the ransomware, encrypting their files, and demanding a ransom.
  
Introduction:
  Psycho is a Golang-based ransomware designed for research and educational purposes. It demonstrates how ransomware spreads through Trojan horse techniques, tricking victims into downloading a disguised malicious file.

How It Works:
  A fake game webpage (Dragon Hunt) is created to trick users. 
  Victims receive a phishing email with a link to the webpage. 
  They download the ransomware, thinking it’s a game. 
  Upon execution, files are encrypted, and a ransom note appears demanding payment.

Key Features:
  Advanced File Encryption – Secures victim’s files using strong encryption algorithms.
  Trojan-Based Distribution – Delivered through a fake game download.
  Anonymous Ransom Payment – Demands cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Monero) for decryption.

Security Precautions:
  Do not download files from untrusted sources.
  Verify email senders before clicking links.
  Use updated security software to detect threats.
  Maintain regular data backups to prevent data loss.

Legal Disclaimer:
  This project is for educational and ethical hacking purposes only. Unauthorized use or distribution of ransomware is illegal and punishable by law. The creator is not responsible for any misuse.
